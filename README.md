# Counter App with Parent-Child Communication
This project demonstrates the use of React state, passing functions between parent and child components, and handling events in React. It includes a Counter component that can increase and decrease its count and a parent component that controls multiple counters.

## Features
Two Counter Components: Each Counter has a state for the count, initialized to 0, with buttons to increase or decrease the count.
Parent Component (CounterControl): This component manages the state of two child Counter components and has a button to reset both counters to 0.
Bonus Feature: An input field to set an initial count value for each Counter component.

## Technologies Used
React (for component structure and state management)
JavaScript (ES6+)
HTML/CSS (for basic styling)

## Bonus
The input field allows you to set the initial count for both counters.
The reset function is passed from the parent component to reset both counters to 0.
